- 👋 Hi, I’m @GiueseppeS, VFX artist for movies. 
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, I don't play too much but I'm interested in the coding part :)
- 🌱 I’m currently improving C# (Linq and .NET), phyton, django and Godot! Also improving my skills in nuke, even if I'm almost a senior, knowledge never end :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some project in Godot! I love the idea of an open source game engine
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github, gspositofx@gmail.com, joecantcode01 in X, and probanly on the moon too.
